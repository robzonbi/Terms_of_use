    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> July 30, 2025</p>

            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
            <p>MetaPi is a mobile app that allows you to edit photos (crop, rotate, flip), edit image metadata
                (EXIF/IPTC), and share photos manually using your device‚Äôs built-in sharing tools. All features operate
                entirely on your device; MetaPi does not store, transmit, or process your data on any remote
                servers‚Äîexcept when you choose to share your files with third-party apps, such as Google Drive. In such
                cases, those apps handle your data independently according to their own privacy policies.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>2. Age Restriction</h2>
            <p>You must be at least 18 years old or have parental permission to use this app.</p>

        <li>
            <h2>3. Data and Privacy</h2>
            <p>MetaPi does not collect or store personal data on any external server. All data remains local to your
                device unless you choose to share it. Sharing is done manually through your phone‚Äôs native sharing tools
                (e.g. Google Drive, Dropbox), and those third-party services have their own privacy policies.</p>
            <p>For more information, please review our <a href="https://robzonbi.github.io/Privacy_policy/">Privacy
